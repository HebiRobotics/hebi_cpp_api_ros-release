ros-kinetic-hebi-cpp-api (2.1.0-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Updated various messages:
    
      * Info:
        
          * Added "serial" getter for Info packets
        
      * Info and Command:
        
          * Added mstop strategy
          * Added position limit strategies
          * Added velocity limits
          * Added effort limits
          * Added flag for whether or not accelerometer feedback includes gravity (on supporting devices, namely Mobile IO devices
        
      * Command:
        
          * Added ability to set strings for and clear the "log" text field in the Mobile IO apps
        
      * Feedback:
        
          * Added "pwm command" feedback
        
    
  * Add "robot element metadata" that allows for introspection of RobotModel objects.
  * Import/Export safety parameters from/to a file into/from GroupCommand objects
  * Export safety parameters to a file from GroupInfo objects
  * Added "experimental" namespace intended for feature-preview items
  * Added "mobile io wrapper" to experimental namespace that allows for easier interface with Mobile IO devices
  * Update core C API from 1.4.2 to 1.8.0
    
      * Significantly faster Jacobian computation
      * Full wildcard lookup supported when creating groups
      * Significantly faster trajectory solver implementation
      * Added "subaddress" support in lookup, commands, feedback, and logging; allows for simulator support
    
  * Cleaned up code style:
    
      * default destructors and accessibility for deleted copy/move assignment operators
      * const on move operators (src/util.hpp)
      * made several getters inline
    
  * Added "FunctionCallResult" used when importing safety parameter files to allow error message to be accessed
  * Update core C API from 1.4.2 to 1.8.0
    
      * Fixed getters for motor position, ar position, ar orientation, ar quality, and battery level in feedback
      * Locale invariant conversion when reading in .xml files, such as gains and HRDF (always expect "1.23" instead of "1,23", regardless of system's locale setting)
      * Use Ethernet header instead of message packet content to discover modules on the network (fixes issue when using multiple interfaces - wired and wireless - on iPad or Android running HEBI Mobile I/O)

ros-kinetic-hebi-cpp-api (2.0.2-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Make package installable
  * Moved the header files into an include directory
  * Removed the Eigen folder; use ROS package instead
  * Fixed CMake for installable package
    
      * Addressed Eigen dependency
      * Installed include files and libraries correctly
    
  * NOTE: this does not correspond with an official 2.0.2
    release of the upstream HEBI C++ API, because these
    changes were all local ROS build system changes. This
    mismatch will be resolved in v2.1.0.
