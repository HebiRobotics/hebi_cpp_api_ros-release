ros-melodic-hebi-cpp-api (2.0.2-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Make package installable
  * Moved the header files into an include directory
  * Removed the Eigen folder; use ROS package instead
  * Fixed CMake for installable package
    - Addressed Eigen dependency
    - Installed include files and libraries correctly
  * NOTE: this does not correspond with an official 2.0.2
    release of the upstream HEBI C++ API, because these
    changes were all local ROS build system changes. This
    mismatch will be resolved in v2.1.0.
